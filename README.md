Title: GoodReadforMagnificentCenturyFans
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2017
Review: I have become fascinated with the Ottomans, Roxelana and Suleiman after watching "The Magnificent Century" a Turkish series that is available through some streaming services. After beginning the series, I wanted to learn more about Roxelana and Suleiman and discover what is accurate and what is dramatic license in the show. That is where Ms. Peirce's book comes into play. When I saw this book pop up I just knew I had to have it. Ms. Peirce does the best job possible piecing together the few fragments that remain regarding who Roxelana was and what she had done while favorite and then wife of Suleiman. I found it very interesting and informative how Ms. Peirce would explain how Ottoman tradition handled concubines and then mother's of sons prior to Roxelana and then how she broke the mold and helped to create a new tradition for women. I learned a great deal from reading this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Ottomans, Roxelana and Suleiman.Ms. Peirce has done a wonderful job but she, of course, has the same pitfalls of most authors who chose to write about women during this time period in that there just isn't a ton of information. Very little survives of Roxelana's own writings and no one bothered to write down for posterity her thoughts or beliefs. What we have are a small number of letters she wrote and some diplomatic correspondences from people who had their own agendas and biases. Many times Ms. Peirce is forced to make educated guesses or assumptions about Roxelana's motives or involvements in certain events because there isn't anything available from Roxelana's own writings. I walked away from the book sad because of how monumental this woman was for the Ottomans and for their traditions and cultures and yet so very little is known or written about her. If I hadn't watched "The Magnificent Century" I am not sure I ever would've known she even existed. It's hard not to walk away from the book a little melancholy for all the lost history.

Title: AfabulousbiographyofoneofthemostfamousOttomanwomen
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2018
Review: This is an incredible story of a famous Ottoman royal written by the brilliant historian Leslie Peirce! It‚Äôs a story of how one woman can change everything, can change an empire! Roxelana was a 16th century slave who rose through the ranks to become the legal wife of the greatest Ottoman Sultan that ever lived‚Äî Suleiman the Magnificent. His reign was the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù of the empire.I don‚Äôt see many mainstream books about the Ottoman Empire and often they are horribly erroneous or disappointing! Ottoman history is complicated and it‚Äôs pivotal that historians use the right sources and records. Using the letters and journals of Europeans is not a realistic depiction of the Ottomans, and its important that historians use actual Ottoman records and use the books and materials of Turkish historians who have access to these records. Peirce is a stellar historian and writer who has done her research responsibly and really does the Ottomans justice. I have also read her previous book The Imperial Harem, which was also excellent! She has conducted her research of Ottoman history meticulously, using sources that get us closest to the records of what really happened. It‚Äôs shocking how some writers have taken ridiculous liberties with the Ottoman past to conjure up a history that has nothing to do with the real thing!Roxelana was one of the most powerful women in the Ottoman Empire and broke the glass ceiling for royal women there at the time. Her story is an inspiring look at how one woman can bring so much influence and change to a leader and an empire, even if given no official role or title! Suleiman repeatedly came to her for counsel. She acted as a diplomat with foreign powers through her letters and was beneficent in her good work and philanthropy, especially for the city of Istanbul. She endowed mosques, schools, soup kitchens, Sufi lodges and hospitals. At one point she even sold her own gold, pearls and jewels to pay for Janissary (Ottoman soldier‚Äôs) boots and a hike in their pay. Her work surpassed that of any previous Ottoman woman in volume and geographic reach.The Ottoman dynasty ruled a large part of Europe for six centuries and its royals were basically European Muslims, though most people in the US know little about them. Traditionally Ottoman Sultans did not marry and could have hundreds of consorts and concubines. They were acquired female slaves, usually from Christian populations, who were chosen for beauty, health and strength. These slaves were housed in closed apartments overseen by a complex organization of women and black eunuchs, which was the harem. However Suleiman didn‚Äôt follow any of these rules-- he chose to be monogamous to one woman, Roxelana. He defied tradition when he married her!I was so happy that the The New York Times Book Review featured this book and gave it a positive review! I loved it and hope more people who are interested in history will learn about the great and influential women of the Ottoman Empire.

Review: I became interested in reading this book after watching the series on Netflix "Suleyman the Magnificent". This book was written no doubt to take advantage of interest in this subject that arose from this popular series. I am quite disappointed in this book. As a biography, it is boring. The author is no doubt a learned historian and expert on the Ottoman Empire. What she is not is a good author. This book is bits of biography of Roxelenna thrown around facts of the Ottoman Empire, which is the emphasis. It is sickening that the author refuses to say anything critical of the Empire or its practices but engages in sugar coating all aspects of the Empire and Islam in general. Frequently in the book there are passages like 'maybe this happened' or 'maybe she felt this' or 'maybe she saw this as she traveled between the palaces" is tedious uninteresting reading. Leslie Peirce has used the series to sell her book, which is full of Ottoman information like a history book, not really a biography. I am not happy with it and should have done more research before purchasing.
